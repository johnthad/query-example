Open a query on a live database. Records are requested repeatedly until the query is complete. Each call returns a page of data, and the hitlist displays that data in a ` <vaadin-grid>` element. The user can jump between pages.

This element also shows sliding `<div>`s in and out, from query to hit list and back.
